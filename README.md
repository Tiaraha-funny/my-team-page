# My team Page

## Structure

In this website I am working on scss. To get start, I need follow these steps:

1- Create the package.json 

2- Install node modules by using npm i -D node-sass so that I get the dev independancy

3- Create gitignore file to ignore the node_modules

4- Once the package is created, edit the scripts code about css and css watch to run the code

## The design

I have a figma app and I work with that to help me.
